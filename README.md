RaleighCrime
============

This is an HDInsight demo using Raleigh crime data.  You will want to have the HDInsight emulator installed or try this against an Azure instance.

All crime data is available at https://data.raleighnc.gov/Police/Police-Incident-Data-All-Dates-Master-File/csw9-dd5k.  Alternatively, I have saved a copy of the CSV file I used in the Data folder, named Police.zip
